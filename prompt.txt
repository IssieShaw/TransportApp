Task - Background

A company has a number of means of transport - comprising a mixture of cars, vans & boats.
The company wishes to store details of its vehicles in a system. (But we are not concerned about any database access as part of this task).
 
Task

Create a series of classes that may be used to hold data on each of the means of transport (car / van / boat) – to include properties such as:
 
its type (car / van / boat)
its dimensions
its weight
its fuel type
its purchase date
its value
number of doors (van & car only)
keel depth (boat only)
 

In a .NET 8 C# console application:
 
Create a list of each type of transport
Add a minimum of five items to each list, with test values of all the items properties populated
Write the items out to 3 CSV files – one per method of transport into files in a named folder (defined in appsettings.json)
Calculate the total value of the transport that is owned by the company and list on the screen:
 
Total number of cars
Total number of vans
Total number of boats
Total value of cars
Total value of vans
Total value of boats
 

Using LINQ, list on the screen the minimum and maximum values of each of the methods of transport
 

I am looking for:

Examples of class inheritance
Knowledge of class constructors
Knowledge and explanation of variable types when defining properties
Knowledge of list creation and subsequent iteration operations
Exception handling (folders not being present etc)
Handling of external resources (i.e. CSV files)
Correct use of data types for the properties
Basic understanding of LINQ
